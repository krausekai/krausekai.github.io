Page links are matched at from the start, within, or end of a string via an optional ``subfollow_pos`` field, with the values of ``startswith``, ``includes``, ``endswidth`` and ``regex``. Sub-follows should be relative to the same host or page.
- Added optional ``follow_pos`` field for the position of where the follow term exists. Same as ``subfollow_pos`` above.

Previously, there was an internal wait time of 1200 milliseconds, which has now been reduced to 50. This internal change will break sites with dynamic texts, unless the ``wait_time`` field is used. This will otherwise speed up site processing.
